## The Sensorberg Android Team is Excited to Announce a New SDK Version.
It has been a long time in the works... The Android team has be toiling
away. The 1.2.0 and forth coming 2.0.0 release changes have/will mainly focus on
refactoring changes, rather than new functionality. The SDK needed a big spring
cleaning, so for the past few months we have been trimming, cleaning and reworking to
make the SDK even better, lighter and easier to use. 


# Some Highlights of 1.2.0:
<ul>
<li>We have updated the networking library and more changes coming in 2.0.0.</li> 
<li>We have added an advertiser id with added control of the ID (which will be discussed in a seperate blog).</li>
<li>Realm for DBs is out and SugarORM is in.</li> 
<li>We added much need coverage to our unit tests..</li>
</ul>

The SDK can be found on bintray at: <a href="https://bintray.com/sensorberg/maven/android-sdk/1.2.0">Android 1.2.0 SDK</a>

To use it, you can just change the sdk version in your build.gradle.

For Example:

```
project.ext.sensorbergSDKVersion = "1.2.0"   
project.ext.RC_VERSION = ""
```

We have also updated the Showcase Application.  You shouldn't notice any funtionality changes, as ussual
if you find any issues please let us know! The showcase can be found here: <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sensorberg.android.showcase&hl=en">Android Showcase App on Google Play.</a>
