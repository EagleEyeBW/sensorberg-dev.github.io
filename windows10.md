## Compatibility ##

Sensorberg SDK for Windows is supported on Windows 10.

Sensorberg SDK has a dependency to SQLite library, which does not support
"Any CPU" configuration. Thus, your Sensorberg application will only support
x86, x64 and ARM builds.

Theck the [documentation over at github](https://github.com/sensorberg-dev/windows10-sdk).
